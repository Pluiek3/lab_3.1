# Lab_2

Subject: Development of a library for operations on matrices of the tool software in Linux OS using.

Objective of the work: To study methods of implementing operations on matrices in the C language, using development tools in the Linux OS; to master the practices of debugging program code using gdb, the Doxygen source code documentation system, as well as the principles of preparing autotests to check the correctness of the library functions using the CUnit framework; to understand the basic principles of using the distributed git version control system.

The purpose of the work determines the formulation and solution of the following tasks:
1. Familiarization with the implementation features of basic operations on matrices (creation,
input / output, addition, multiplication, transposition, finding the determinant).
2. Reinforcing skills in using mechanisms for working with pointers and
dynamic memory allocation in the C language for matrices.
3. Setting up an automated Makefile build.
4. Setting up a version control system using git.
- 4.1 Creating a repository for the project.
- 4.2 Basic operations for working with code versions.
- 4.3 Designing a README file describing the functionality of the library for
github.com.
5. Mastering code debugging tools using gdb.
- 5.1 Working with breakpoints in critical parts of the code.
- 5.2 Step-by-step tracing of program execution.
- 5.3. Analysis of variable values ​​during execution.
6. Analysis of the correctness of the program code using the tools cppcheck, clang-analyzer,
valgrind.
7. Preparation of autotests to check the correctness of the library using the CUnit framework.
8. Performing code markup using Doxygen, generating documentation.
9. Performing an individual task related to calculating expressions with
dynamic matrices, using the developed library. The task number
is determined by the student's number in the journal. If the number exceeds the maximum number of
tasks, the variant is calculated using the formula: journal number % maximum task number (where % is the remainder of the division).
10. Reflect in the report:
- a) description of the structure of the developed library;
- b) texts of the library and tests with comments;
- c) prepared test data and results;
- d) other materials related to the progress of the work;
- e) conclusions on the correctness and effectiveness of the implementation.

## Compiling

Command to compile and run:

```
make run
```
### Running the tests

Command to run tests:

```
make test
```

## Documentation 

Command to generate Doxygen documentation:

```
doxygen Doxyfile
```
The project used a custom style developed by jothepro. The style is in the directory (./Docs/doxygen-awasome-cdd-main).

The documentation itself is located in (./Docs/doxygen), this documentation contains a description of all the main elements of the project.
